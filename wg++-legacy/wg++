  Introduction:
    Webgrabber+Plus was never intended to be installed in a Unix operating
    system. It was intended to be used as a folder to which the user has
    read/write access. This script was needed to make it behave like a real
    application, installed in the operating system.

    http://www.webgrabplus.com/content/solved-command-line-option-specifying-config-file-name

  Usage:
    $script <path>

  Settings:
    Without a path, the default configuration directory is used or
    will be created if it is missing.
    <path> = path to configuration directory

    The configuration template is stored in '/usr/share/wg++'.
    Copy it to your preferred location:
      cp -R '/usr/share/wg++' '/path/to/configuration_directory'

  Examples:
    $script
    $script '/path/to/configuration_directory'

  Config:
    config path  = $config_path
    config file  = $config_file
    exec command = $exec_cmd"
